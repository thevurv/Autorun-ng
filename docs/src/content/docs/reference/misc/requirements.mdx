## Linux

You're gonna need [GModPatchTool](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModPatchTool) to even run the game.

Beyond that, that's it.

## Windows

Currently only 64 bit builds are provided. Meaning you must use the x86-64 branch of GMod.

There's no particular reason for this, other than that 32 bit is untested and that you really should move to 64 bit.
