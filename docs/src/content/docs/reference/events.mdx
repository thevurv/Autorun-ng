Autorun-ng provides a generic event system which allows you to trigger custom events and add callbacks to any event.

## Built-in Events

These are events that will be called from Rust by Autorun itself.

### `loadbuffer`

<Card>
**Parameters:**
- `buffer` (string) - The Lua code buffer that is being loaded
- `filename` (string) - The name of the file being loaded
**Returns:** None
</Card>

This event is triggered whenever a Lua code buffer is loaded by Garry's Mod. You can use this event to inspect or modify the code before it is executed.

```lua
Autorun.on("loadbuffer", function(buffer, filename)
    Autorun.print("Loading buffer from file: " .. filename)
end)
```

<Aside type="note">
    This is what the lua dumper plugin uses to dump lua code!

## Custom Events

You can create and trigger your own custom events using the `Autorun.trigger` function.

### `Autorun.trigger(eventName, ...)`
<Card>
**Parameters:**
- `eventName` (string) - The name of the event to trigger
- `...` (any) - Any number of additional arguments to pass to the event callbacks
**Returns:** Any single value returned by the first callback to return a non-nil value
</Card>
