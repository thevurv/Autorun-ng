This is [Autorun](https://github.com/thevurv/Autorun-rs) for the next generation.

## Features

- 🖥️ Launcher UI. No menu plugins, or manual injection. Just start Autorun and press play.
- 🐧 🤝 🪟 Both Linux and Windows are supported.
- 📂 Fully sandboxed filesystem powered by [cap-std](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std), which webassembly uses for their sandboxing.
- 🔒 All Autorun functions now ensure they're running in Autorun, just in case you accidentally leak them to \_G.
- 🌑 A refreshing new set of Lua API bindings - **[autorun-lua](./packages/autorun-lua)**. This was built from the ground up to be ergonomic and replace [rglua](https://github.com/thevurv/rglua) and gmod-rs. _You can use this outside of Autorun-ng for your own binary module projects._
- 👨🏻‍💻 A new set of interface bindings, **[autorun-interfaces](./packages/autorun-interfaces)**. This is a zero dependency library which provides access to source engine interfaces. _You can use this outside of Autorun-ng for your own binary module projects._
- ✅ Running code in the menu state, menu plugins are no longer.
